Periodically I write autobiographical comics. During 2018 I wrote 98 comics using PowerPoint and put them on Instagram. You can read my thoughts about it (and see some of them) [at the main blog](https://joereddington.github.io/2019/08/18/comics.html) 


The project naturally come to an end, but several years later I started occasionally making some again. This time I used html and css to give a much more accessible final product, even if it was more labour-intensive. You can see the finished comics below.
