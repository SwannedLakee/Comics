# Comics in HTML 

* A small project to improve my css, and possibly start making comics again. 
* Big thanks to [this repo](https://gist.github.com/CodeMyUI/7bf5995a4bcfbb294d172a5c5e1feb7f) where I learned almost everything in the initial import
* Also big thanks to the designer of the crimefighter font, which is awesome.
